## Interests
From a young age, I've been deeply immersed in the world of gaming, finding endless fascination in the diverse realms and experiences it offers. Music has also been a significant part of my life since I discovered my passion for drumming during my early teens. Both gaming and drumming have remained integral parts of my journey, contributing to my joy and creative fulfillment in distinct yet equally meaningful ways.
